How To Play:

Use WASD to cover the targeted coffin to prevent the vampires' skulls from attaked by the falling crosses. When the cross is approaching the coffin, the coffin would be trembling. As the time passing, the tempo of falling crosses would speed up, do your best to let more skulls left!
There are three vampire's skulls in each coffin. In the end, if there is at least one skull left in a coffin , that means the vampire would be resurrected. You would get bonus scores!
